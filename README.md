# Ender IO - Reforged

This mod is a rewrite / modern port of the excellent mod EnderIO written by SleepyTrousers
over [here](https://github.com/SleepyTrousers/EnderIO)

## Information

* This mod uses the assets and recipes from the original EnderIO mod
* However, the code is basically re-written from scratch, and uses the Fabric API instead of the Forge API
* I'm aiming to follow the same features as the original mod, but I may tweak values and timings to better balance with
  other tech mods currently in Fabric
    * TechReborn
    * Industrial Revolution
    * Modern Industrialization
    * etc.

## FAQ

* What mod loader does this use?
    * Fabric
* Will this ever support the Forge loader
    * Never say never. But there aren't any plans at the moment
